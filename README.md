# rideshare-traffic-model
MATLAB based traffic model that simulates ridesharing with different path optimizations

This project was completed in the Fall Semester of 2018 in the NYU Courant course MATH-UA-395: Special Topics in Mathematical Modelling with Professors Charles Peskin and Charles Puelz.

Reading through the [report](Project%20Report/Project%202%20report.pdf) will give a better sense of the scope of the project. Each folder (besides the Project Report folder) has a different type of route simulation chosen by the ride sharing cars.

\**disclaimer: Although the name 'Uber' is used throughout, the project has no association with the company and in the scope of this project, Uber is synonomous with a ridesharing car.*

**TODO: Add a more interactive version of the simulation**
